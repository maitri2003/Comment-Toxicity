Comment Toxicity Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to detect toxic comments and provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. The model is trained on labeled comment data and predicts whether a given comment is toxic or not toxic, along with a probability score.

Features

Preprocessing of raw text (stopword removal, emoji removal, cleaning).

Machine learning pipeline using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.

Streamlit-based web interface for real-time comment toxicity prediction.

Outputs both classification (toxic / not toxic) and probability score.
